## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Built with **React 18**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Web Audio API**. Features a modular component architecture with centralized state management using React Context for themes and audio processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges

### 1. **Audio Synchronization**
**Challenge**: Ensuring precise timing across all audio tracks while maintaining low latency.
**Solution**: Implemented a centralized timing system using `setInterval` with BPM-based calculations and Web Audio API for sample-accurate playback.

### 2. **Cross-Browser Audio Compatibility**
**Challenge**: Different browsers handle Web Audio API initialization and autoplay policies differently.
**Solution**: Created an AudioManager class with proper context resumption and fallback handling for various browser implementations.

### 3. **Dynamic Theme System**
**Challenge**: Implementing a comprehensive theme system that affects all UI elements including sliders and interactive components.
**Solution**: Developed a hybrid approach using CSS-in-JS for dynamic elements and CSS custom properties for static styling, with a custom hook for real-time slider updates.

### 4. **Responsive Grid Layout**
**Challenge**: Creating a responsive sequencer grid that maintains proper proportions across different screen sizes.
**Solution**: Implemented a flexible grid system using CSS Grid and Flexbox with dynamic sizing calculations based on container width.

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
**Challenge**: Maintaining smooth animations and real-time audio processing without performance degradation.
**Solution**: Used React.memo for component optimization, implemented efficient state management, and optimized audio buffer handling.

## üéµ Future Enhancements

### **Tone.js Integration** (Coming Soon)
The project is planned for a major upgrade to [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), a powerful Web Audio framework that will enable:

- **Advanced Synthesis**: Built-in synthesizers and effects
- **Better Timing**: More precise audio scheduling and synchronization
- **Effects Processing**: Reverb, delay, compression, and more
- **MIDI Support**: External controller integration
- **Advanced Patterns**: More sophisticated pattern generation algorithms
- **Real-time Effects**: Dynamic audio processing and manipulation

### **Additional Features Planned**
- **More Drum Kits**: Additional sample packs and sound libraries
- **Pattern Export**: Save and share custom patterns
- **Advanced Sequencing**: 32-step and 64-step sequencer modes
